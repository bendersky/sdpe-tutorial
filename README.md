# Search and Discovery in Personal Email Collections (WSDM 2022 Tutorial)

## Introduction
Even in the age of social networks, instant messaging, and video conferencing email still remains an important medium for personal and professional communication. In addition, email has grown in importance as a B2C communication channel, and as a repository for recent and past commercial transactions. In the past decade, there has been a resurgence of interest in email search and discovery research, mainly led by industrial research labs such as Yahoo! Research, Microsoft Research, and Google Research. This research has been accompanied by the development of new user-visible features, such as hybrid chronological-relevance search, knowledge panels, assistant integration, and smart composition. In this half day tutorial we will provide an overview of this recent research, as well as a survey of decades of academic research that laid the foundation for these newer developments. Our hope is that this tutorial will lead to better recognition of the unique technologies behind our everyday email tools, and will also inspire researchers to think beyond the scope of the current paradigms.

## Schedule
The tutorial will be held as a _half-day tutorial_ virtually on Monday, February 21st, 2022.

### Topics outline
*  **Introduction** to the key research challenges and unique properties of email search and discovery.
*  **The Anatomy of an Email Search Engine** -- a high level overview of the various components of email search engines, including user interfaces, ranking, query and document understanding, and evaluation.
*  **Data Management** -- an overview of techniques designed to keep user data private, while developing new models for effective search and discovery. We will also propose techniques for dealing with bias and sparsity in user interaction data (e.g., clicks).
*  **Intelligent Task Assistance** -- going beyond search, and discussing other modes of personal content discovery, including recommendation, activity prediction, and assistive composition, as well as new frontiers in email search and discovery.

## Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval Survey
The tutorial is based on the Foundations and Trends® in Information Retrieval survey published by the tutorial authors. The aim of the tutorial is to provide a high-level entry point for those interested in the topics of the survey. We will revisit its main themes, and provide pointers on the important papers in each of the fields.

The survey will be available for download [here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1561/1500000069) for the duration of WSDM 2022 (Feb. 21 -- Feb. 25). A pre-print version of the survey will be available for download in the tutorial materials thereafter.
